CLASSIFICATION MODELS (Tier + Sector):
  ✓ Engagement Tier: Test Acc=0.5120, CV Acc=0.5007
    CV/Test gap = 0.0113 (low gap = stable)
    → Reliability: Good. Model learns robust patterns from user inputs.

  ✓ Sector: Test Acc=1.0000
    → Reliability: Good. Sector depends on categories + text features.

REGRESSION MODELS (Metrics):
  ✓ Views: Test R²=0.6830, MAE=210,655
    → Predicts view count magnitude. R² > 0.5 is acceptable for content metrics.

  ✓ Likes: Test R²=0.6812, MAE=4,993
    → Predicts likes. Lower R² typical for engagement (more variance).

  ✓ Comments: Test R²=0.5987, MAE=939
    → Predicts comments. Most volatile metric.

  ✓ Engagement Rate: Test R²=-0.0035, MAE=0.038472
    → Predicts engagement rate (0–1 scale). Direct metric from inputs.

INTERPRETATION:
  • Classification models (tier + sector) should be used for high-confidence predictions.
  • Regression models (metrics) predict order-of-magnitude and trends, not exact values.
  • All models use only 9 user-friendly features → highly deployable in Streamlit.
  • If CV/test gaps are small, models are stable and will generalize well.
