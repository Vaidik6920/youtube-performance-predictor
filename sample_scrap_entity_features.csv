'australia best place', 'australians best', 'oz', 'aus best country', 'aussie']",The Geography Bible,114927,866,3067,164000,20210511,0,ah australia the land down under the sixth largest country in the world by land size but only the 55th most populated australia is one of if not my favorite country in the world after visiting there multiple times throughout my life i can truly vouch for how amazing it is australia has it all big fun cities tropical beaches rainforests desert and interesting historical culture so in this video we've made a list of 10 reasons why australia is the best country in the world and this is coming from a brit if you disagree with any of our points or perhaps you are australian yourself and you can confirm them then let us know in the comments section below we love reading your comments so starting off with number 10 it's population density although it's major cities like sydney melbourne and brisbane may be rather densely populated australia as a whole is one of the least densely populated countries on earth i think we can all agree this is a positive thing as who would want to live in a crowded congested place australia has roughly 3.3 people per kilometers squared making it the sixth most sparsely populated country on earth western australia is even lower at just 2.5 people per kilometers squared perth the main city of western australia is one of if not the most isolated city in the world the nearest city with a population of over 100 000 is adelaide over 2100 kilometers away number nine the lifestyle the australian lifestyle favors the enjoyment of free time with family friends sports and contact with nature work is a fundamental value of society but must be accompanied by the necessary time for rest and recreational activities the majority of australia experiences fantastic weather year rounds meaning that barbecues outdoor socializing and swims in the sea are a part of everyday life try doing that in the uk in the middle of january you will end up with hypothermia number eight high minimum wage and great salaries nowhere else in the world would you get such a high minimum wage when you compare the minimum wage of australians to any other country you would find that the pay rate is more than ten dollars higher than the competitor countries this includes large countries like the uk the us france and any other country in between jobs that pay quite decently in the uk are usually super highly paid in australia especially jobs in construction and finance number seven high health score australia is one of the world's healthiest countries for several different reasons australia offers its people one of the world's best health care systems it has one of the lowest infant mortality scores and a high life expectancy smoking is low in australia too with a continuously declining number of smokers the vitamin d that they get from the sunshine surely must be a factor too being outside being active and healthy in the sun is a lot better for your mental and physical health than staying indoors in the freezing cold dark nights like we have in the winter in the uk number six the beaches where else in the world can you go to a new beach every day and it will take you 27 years if you want to accomplish that well that's australia for you there's so many beaches it would take you 27 years to visit every beach if you visited one every single day what is more an aussie beach is hard to beat from the magnificent city beaches to the pumping surf of the unspoiled wild and natural beaches every beach is a contender to be better than any other beach in the rest of the world number five major attractions it is impossible to live in australia and wonder where you could go for your next vacation because there's so many choices this country certainly has it all from sydney to melbourne to the great barrier reef to the giant lake the majestic outback and the unblemished beauty of the northern territory you will love australia australia has something for everyone number four it has every type of climate and terrain from mountains to beaches to rainforests to deserts quite similar to the usa australia is so big it has every type of climate and terrain there is to offer there is no need to leave your country if your country offers everything the world has to offer for example in the uk we do have beaches and forests but we certainly do not have those tropical beaches that australia offers number three the people in my opinion aussies are friendlier than most other citizens from around the world sometimes even too friendly some say it's the weather others say it's the carefree attitude the aussie motto is she'll be right which means don't stress it's all good in australia you're someone's mate until proven otherwise this includes your boss as well as that annoying next-door neighbor you'll be amazed by the welcoming and laid-back nature of the natives aussies and brits are like two brothers they do argue and they fall out sometimes but deep down we really do like each other number two tasmania has the world's cleanest air the north western tip of tasmania on the cape grim peninsula is where you'll find the cleanest air in the world this is because the air is cleaned while it travels for thousands of kilometers over the ocean before arriving at the tasmanian coast heck it's so good they even sell cans and bottles of air to other countries who have polluted air and finally number one wildlife australia horse a high biodiversity compared to other regions in the world it has very unique wildlife such as kangaroos koalas quakers and many more native animals and plants are waiting for you these squirrels in london's hyde park are adorable but would you miss the opportunity to meet kangaroos hug a koala or take a quacker selfie on rottnest island off the coast of perth yes australia is home to deadly creepy crawlies and snakes but they are extremely rare in urban areas so there we have it 10 reasons why we think australia is the best country in the world of course just like any other country in the world it's not perfect it does have some drawbacks but we believe that australia ranks highly in so many different areas thank you so much for watching have a great week and we'll see you soon and of course remember to like and subscribe if you want to

Gaming,38821,468,2251,103000,20230406,0,when it comes to for spoken we need to talk about forespoken and I feel so bad I don't know if you have heard the news but the company got bought by Square Enix and that is probably and most likely and because of the sales of forespoken and a direct result of the council culture I want to call it that actually people were hating so much on the game and maybe I will be one of the few people that will speak up about four spoken and say I loved the game I Platinum trophied for spoken I am replaying for spoken I have done everything in the game I have been enjoying this game so much I need to tell you guys this because like I said in my review Bomb Video this game I feel like it was done unjustly so review bombed and so many negative reviews to forespoke and I don't get it I actually don't get it it is a fantastic open world beautiful game with Park Quarry traversal and this is like the smoothest parkoural traversal I have seen or played in any video game I am so used to that parkour traversal that when I am jumping into another game right now where my character is walking more slowly I feel like I just want to play for spoken again it feels so good and I said this in my previous video about for spoken but it is so fun to play fun to grind in and it was so fun to do all of the trophies for this game my very last trophy being upgrade all your spells I had such a blast at doing this I still think that this is a great game now if you are on the fence sure get it on sale it will most likely go on sale pretty soon because the sales were not doing good but all the negative reviews they were saying that the story was bad and that they didn't like like the character the character could have been improved a tiny bit she was very rude even our thoughts are you know and that cream she cuts in that was kind of viral for a moment that is 0.01 of my game experience in the game that passes by so fast that is like in the beginning of the game and I'm 70 hours in this game or more I don't remember but that did not Define my experience with the game it was actually the open world and let me just tell you the combat the magical combat fantastic when you have unlocked all of the four elements it is so much fun so much fun I cannot stress that enough I feel like the game had sold the developers poured their souls into this game I'm loving the regions of the game and the game does not end after you have completed the main story when the main story is done I feel like that is when the game opens up you have gotten all the four elements there are so many hidden and Secret World bosses to take on and a lot of the late game end game challenges there was one in particular that drove me almost nuts and that is getting to the far Coast Terrace I did it eventually and also that dancing trophy was terrible I had to get neighbor Stefan over here and help me with that one because that one was really hard I found for spoken to be a very good mindless game also when you're done with the story stuff which I paid a lot of attention into it's a great game to turn your brain off in and just mindlessly do all of the objectives on this huge huge map and I did all of the quests and I found the hidden store was so surprised when I found out there are actually a few living NPCs out there in the world now the story is that you are this girl from New York going through this portal long story short to this magical world where there is a break which is like a plague and all the people have sort of died to the plague and I've been reading a lot into the lore of the game which is huge and I think the lore that they created for this fantasy Universe it definitely has the potential to get a sequel but that will probably never happen [Music] because the game was received so badly I just don't get it now of course everyone is entitled to their own opinion I am also and I am saying that I love that it's kind of hard to argue against that the magical Parker the actual way that you are traversing this world thought it is bad the game is fun it is probably the most fun that I've played this year and someone predicted this on Discord sort of saying that oh my God I think Isha likes for spoken more than Hogwarts Legacy they are very different games now Hogwarts Legacy such a game but it is a bit slower I love flying on the Broom I like the quests and I like the gameplay and that too that is beautifully detailed I have two videos of Hogwarts Legacy up on my channel I've been so addicted to that also but for spoken it's just like a different game I like it in a different way maybe yeah I played for spoken more than Hogwarts Legacy at this point I'm not done with Hogwarts Legacy I have 60 hours in that one I think I have 70 in for spoken but for spoken has just been so fun to jump back into I have been gravitated more towards for spoke just letting you guys know I completed the game completely and the end game is where it is at so I don't want you to brush that game off as a bad game because a lot of people are saying that it is bad I will always love this game so I think you should give it a chance sometime [Music] now that I am done with forespoken and sorta soon done with Hogwarts Legacy I am also right now playing a new game it's not new it's sword on you never mind and that is Star Ocean the Divine Force review code provided thank you now when it comes to Star Ocean I'm going into the series blind I have never played a Star Ocean game before I mean I tried faithfulness and integrity integrity and faithlessness I mean I think that was the title terrible title but I did not get into that Star Ocean game with this one I feel the immediate Improvement and I am now becoming a fan of the series at least this game now it is a jrpg with a fun story the story is not this technologically advanced civilization dude is Crash Landing on this technologically far behind planet and he meets this girl Leticia and this guy is trying to find some of the other plants that were landing on this planet it's a whole thing I like the voice acting I like the story I like the world I like the gameplay this game actually surprised me in a lot of ways I did not expect me to play as much as I did or have already played I thought to myself going into this game that I will give it like five hours or something now I'm way past that I think I'm up in 15 because I haven't been able to put this game away the traversal in the open areas it's not an open world game it's more like connected open areas big areas though you have this ability where you can sip fastly like everywhere and it is so much fun now the exploration part it reminds me of a Xenoblade Chronicles game and the combat actually reminds me of East games very fast action-oriented combat very satisfying and the combat music so good [Music] now the game has a skill point system skill trees a lot of customization into every character of your party to make them stronger that is a lot of fun to mess around with the graphics they are good absolutely but I feel like some of the actual animations are a bit stiff and their mouth is not moving correctly when they're talking I have a lot of fun smashing pots and flying on the rooftops doing a bit of side quests this game has a lot of fun factor in it I'm actually surprised by this title and it just passed me by I know happy console gamer said that he didn't get into this game now I got into it I am currently very into this game and I have never liked a Star Ocean game before now and the story is what keeps me playing which very rarely happens I feel like you don't have to have played any other Star Ocean game as I am jumping into this as a new person now I have a few recommendations and that is you can zoom out in the settings it's kind of a hidden feature if you feel like the characters is close to you you consume the character out of it you can play as a female or male in the start of the story you get that choice and some of the story cut scenes are dependent on who you chose if you want to see everything actually you have to play this game twice definitely enjoying star Ocean's the Divine Force so that is what I'm playing on my PlayStation 5 along with a bit of VR check out my video on the psvr2 fun stuff also I hope you give for spoken a second glance at least I think it is deserving of that and now I have recommended to you the newest Star Ocean and I'm telling you it is good xenoblady is like good now that was all for this video thank you so much for watching and liking hitting that like button and subscribing when you are new or if you just haven't subscribed yet thank you so much for watching and I will see you later

I've been using it twice daily on my&nbsp;&nbsp; frown lines for six weeks now so is&nbsp; this Revox line relaxer really better&nbsp;&nbsp; than Botox or even somewhere close to it? [Music] So the idea with the Revox line relaxer Serum is&nbsp;&nbsp; that you use it twice daily targeting lines on&nbsp; your forehead around your eyes and your mouth,&nbsp;&nbsp; if you have them there, applying it to clean skin&nbsp; and before moisturizing and right up there at the&nbsp;&nbsp; top of the active ingredients list is acetyl&nbsp; hexapeptide 8 which many of you may have heard&nbsp;&nbsp; of by its trade name argireline and it's a&nbsp; neurotransmitter-inhibiting peptide that's&nbsp;&nbsp; also water binding so it's a humectant and that in&nbsp; itself can help with lines because it's attracting&nbsp;&nbsp; moisture to the surface of your skin but as I&nbsp; understand it from reading scientists' take on&nbsp;&nbsp; this ingredient this peptide mimics a particular&nbsp; protein in what's called The Snare Complex which&nbsp;&nbsp; plays an important role in the release of new&nbsp; transmitters and if that complex is slightly&nbsp;&nbsp; destabilized it affects its ability to release&nbsp; neurotransmitters efficiently and that in turn&nbsp;&nbsp; affects the muscle's ability to contract So that's the theory behind how it works&nbsp;&nbsp; and there have been quite a few studies showing&nbsp; argireline helps keep our skin hydrated and has&nbsp;&nbsp; some wrinkle reducing benefits but it's also been&nbsp; found that it doesn't penetrate the deeper layers&nbsp;&nbsp; of the skin and so unlike Botox it's not reaching&nbsp; the muscles to directly freeze or relax them it&nbsp;&nbsp; also means that the thinner your skin the higher&nbsp; the chance argireline can work better for you&nbsp; Now to put it in context argireline is sold&nbsp; for under 10 pounds in the UK and under $10&nbsp;&nbsp; in the US by The Ordinary so it's not on its&nbsp; own an expensive ingredient however that's&nbsp;&nbsp; not the only peptide in this product there are&nbsp; several others along with something called Gaba,&nbsp;&nbsp; an inhibitory neurotransmitter, that you may&nbsp; have heard of and it's supposed to provide&nbsp;&nbsp; the immediate relaxing effect The makers, Revision Skincare,&nbsp;&nbsp; say in their 12-week randomized double-blind&nbsp; placebo-controlled clinical study featuring&nbsp;&nbsp; 55 females aged between 35 and 60 that it&nbsp; was found to improve expression lines at 15&nbsp;&nbsp; minutes after use and over time improved lines&nbsp; wrinkles and skin health including hydration.&nbsp; Inulin a prebiotic ingredient is also included&nbsp; designed to rebalance the skin microbiome and it&nbsp;&nbsp; also includes hyaluronic acid which would help&nbsp; with skin plumping, again by drawing moisture&nbsp;&nbsp; to the surface of our skin from our lower layers&nbsp; but the jury is out on how healthy that actually&nbsp;&nbsp; is for our skin and I guess the ultimate goal&nbsp; would be for us to use products that help our&nbsp;&nbsp; skin create more of its own hyaluronic acid Dr Rajani said in his video that this can be&nbsp;&nbsp; used as a topical alternative to Botox or as a way&nbsp; of extending the results of Botox which is also a&nbsp;&nbsp; benefit of plain old cheap argireline and before&nbsp; I talk about my own experience I often like to&nbsp;&nbsp; look at customer reviews and I wanted to compare&nbsp; The Ordinary's argireline 10 solution with the&nbsp;&nbsp; feedback on the Revox serum because they're at&nbsp; completely different ends of the price spectrum&nbsp; So I looked on Amazon where The Ordinary&nbsp; product has 677 ratings and an average&nbsp;&nbsp; of 4.3 out of 5 stars and it has a lot of&nbsp; devotees as well as a not in significant&nbsp;&nbsp; number who say it did nothing for them and&nbsp; you're always going to get that with any&nbsp;&nbsp; skin care product because our skin types differ Also on Amazon where it's currently out of stock&nbsp;&nbsp; the Revox line relaxer has 93 ratings&nbsp; and an average of 3.9 out of 5 stars&nbsp; Now at 10 times the price customers are going&nbsp; to take a tougher line and are more likely to&nbsp;&nbsp; leave critical feedback if they're not fully&nbsp; satisfied but it is just interesting to see&nbsp;&nbsp; the comparison how much more are you actually&nbsp; getting from the more expensive product which&nbsp;&nbsp; does have considerably more ingredients? From my perspective using it twice daily&nbsp;&nbsp; for around six weeks so that was straight after&nbsp; I filmed my Adipeau review I started using this&nbsp;&nbsp; on my 11s, my vertical frown lines, and a couple&nbsp; of deeper horizontal lines and it comes with a&nbsp;&nbsp; steel tip attached to a little pump so you can&nbsp; just smooth it over the lines you want to target&nbsp; To use it over a longer period of time I would&nbsp; have had to buy another tube and I have decided&nbsp;&nbsp; not to do that based mainly on cost versus return Now I usually get Botox very lightly done once&nbsp;&nbsp; a year and to avoid eyelid sagging because the&nbsp; relaxed muscle can push the brow down I just get&nbsp;&nbsp; tiny amounts put between the brow and a little&nbsp; higher up as well so I still have movement but&nbsp;&nbsp; just less of it the last time I had it done was&nbsp; at the start of January 2022 and I wanted to give&nbsp;&nbsp; this a go before I had it done again to see if&nbsp; it might actually be an effective alternative&nbsp; I've got to say when it comes to my results I&nbsp; don't notice a major difference personally so&nbsp;&nbsp; let's take a look firstly at the difference 15&nbsp; minutes after use here's the before and after&nbsp;&nbsp; footage alongside each other and there's not&nbsp; as far as I can see a particularly noticeable&nbsp;&nbsp; relaxation for the longer term results This is me at the beginning of December&nbsp;&nbsp; and this is me now. There is potentially&nbsp; a slight easing because these are deeper&nbsp;&nbsp; lines and that is going to be tougher for any&nbsp; topical to make an impact on Realistically&nbsp;&nbsp; if I'm looking to smooth out these deeper&nbsp; lines I think I'm going to have to use Botox&nbsp; Now I've not experienced major irritation&nbsp; with the serum but I found it does make&nbsp;&nbsp; my forehead a little bit itchy at times&nbsp; though that decreased with regular use&nbsp; Overall though do I believe that this product&nbsp; and argireline in isolation that they can relax&nbsp;&nbsp; lines and smooth the appearance of the skin?&nbsp; Well yes I do to a point I'm very interested&nbsp;&nbsp; in peptides and growth factors in skin care and&nbsp; I very much think they are the way forward and&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to be bringing you thoughts on a&nbsp; number of products this year at the moment&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm using Calecim's multi-action cream every&nbsp; morning and my 80-year-old mom is using One&nbsp;&nbsp; Skin's face supplements so I'll update on&nbsp; our results and look at some of the most&nbsp;&nbsp; popular alternatives at different price points. A reminder that growth factors are proteins&nbsp;&nbsp; produced by the body's cells including&nbsp; those found in the skin and are used in&nbsp;&nbsp; skincare for their ability to message to&nbsp; skin cells to repair themselves and as a&nbsp;&nbsp; result improve the skin's health and decrease&nbsp; the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles&nbsp; Peptides are molecules made of two or more&nbsp; amino acids that also act as messengers&nbsp;&nbsp; within the skin and to show you the potential&nbsp; of peptides here are a couple of before and&nbsp;&nbsp; after pictures from the Revox product listing on&nbsp; Dr Rajani's site and they are pretty impressive&nbsp; I'm someone with thicker skin and so I don't&nbsp; have many fine lines but I have deeper ones&nbsp;&nbsp; and I think the topical relaxants will have&nbsp; a much more noticeable effect on fine lines&nbsp; Some people have fine lines on their forehead&nbsp; around their eyes and their mouth and if you're&nbsp;&nbsp; not a Botox fan or you want to extend the life&nbsp; of your Botox then it could be helpful for you&nbsp; I'll link to both the Revox serum and The&nbsp; Ordinary serum in the text box below this&nbsp;&nbsp; video. You just click on where it says&nbsp; 'more' to see that information and if&nbsp;&nbsp; like me you're influenced by other customer&nbsp; reviews I'll also link to some inexpensive&nbsp;&nbsp; products that include argireline and are&nbsp; popular with customers including one from&nbsp;&nbsp; the skincare brand Eclat and their&nbsp; face cream with argireline has four&nbsp;&nbsp; thousand reviews and an average of 4.3&nbsp; out of 5 stars and it's under 10 pounds&nbsp; So that's it from me today look out for&nbsp; another dermal debate with Dr Qian and&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivan Galinin this time looking at whether&nbsp; too much red light can be a bad thing&nbsp; For now thanks for watching and&nbsp; I'll see you next time [Music]",25.0,Exploring the Efficacy of Revox Line Relaxer: A Potential Botox Alternative,"A detailed analysis and personal review of the Revox Line Relaxer, featuring comparisons with other skincare products, customer feedback, and scientific insights on its ingredients.",6,Lifestyle
640x360,640,Lifestyle,Home Improvement,BIOHOME ULTIMATE - FILTER MEDIA DOES NOT GET ANY BETTER,"All the Biohome media can be bought here (I supply worldwide): 
http://www.filterpro.co.uk (also has links to other suppliers).
This media combines the ultra porous structure of Biohome mini ultra with the added trace elements found in Biohome plus to create the Ultimate filter media.

With the available surface area supporting aerobic bacteria and the protected inner core supporting anaerobic bacteria, ammonia, nitrite and nitrate are processed effectively. Works well at high and low flow rates so forget about having to force the volume of your aquarium through the media 'x' amount of times per hour as you would with other types of filter media.

Perfect for both fresh water and marine systems, biohome filter media will replace any ceramic or plastic media in external canister, overhead, trickle, shower, hang on or sump filters.

The added trace elements and open pore structure in Biohome Ultimate offer the ultimate home for all beneficial bacteria, cutting the time taken to establish a strong fully functional bacterial colony a matter of 2-3 weeks and include the following:
Silica, Titania, Alumina, Ferric Oxide, Lime, Magnesia, Potash, Soda, Phosphorus Pentoxide, Chromium Sesquioxide, Manganic Oxide, Zirconia, Hafnia, Zinc Oxide, Barium Oxide, Strontia, Stannic Oxide, Sulphur Trioxide. (from XRF analysis)

or sales@filterpro.co.uk

Filter media does not get any better than this but for an extra quick set-up time each order taken from Ebay or through the website has free gel filter starter balls (5 per kg) to rapidly seed the filter with live bacteria.
Forget about adding all sort of sachets and monthly chemical absorbers to your filter. Keep it simple and arrange the filter correctly with the best filter media available. 
Many of the filter products available are a waste of time and money and will simply mask the problems caused by an ineffective filter. See this video on setting up an external canister filter for directions on how to get the most out of your filter and have it working at maximum efficiency:  
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szrUlHTW5Zo
Simply protect the media with good graded foams and fine particle matting / pad to remove suspended solids (which clog any filter media) and your media will give you years of service.
The test in this video is to demonstrate how easily the water can find the inner structure of the media as you can say your media has the largest available area for bacteria but if the water can't get there what is the point?. It is not part of a full comparison between filter different medias. That will come in a future video.

something special now before I show you what it is I'll show you how it evolved this media here is called bio hoon ultra it's extremely porous media pretty big suitable for stumps very big external filters Trickle towers called shower systems it provides an awesome amount of space both externally and internally for bacterial colonization very receptive to bacteria but when I first started selling this thought it's a little bit too big for a lot of the external filters used in aquariums therefore I asked the guy that makes this for me if it was possible to make a media with this awesome porosity same sort of texture but smaller he did just that and that resulted in bio home mini ultra now this stuff is getting rave reviews just check the feedback on eBay it's truly excellent stuff it just sucks the water into it which I'll demonstrate it now yes in bio home mini ultra just picked up the bag at random there you go demonstrates just how poor asada is actually the the level of liquid in that cap is just about disappeared it's sucked at all it has sucked it up that's the bottom I'm gonna have to refill it and that's trace it's all of these fingers but that is just ultra for us but it has the convenient size to fit in overhead filters small externals small internals basically any filter which has space for filter media can use by your own mini ultra and I'm talking about freshwater and marine I tend to forget about marine because in my shop I only deal with freshwater fish and equipment but this stuff apparently by the feedback it has all the benefits of live rock with none of the drawbacks not being into marine fish I don't know what the drawbacks are like rock but apparently this has none of them now I've got to think of you is there a way to make this already awesome media even better now the makers of bible woman do a very small media which is great for compact bill doesn't move ahead filters it's called bio 1 plus which is like a little hard stick and this has added trace elements so i asked if the bio mini ultra could possibly have those trace elements put into it and after consultation with a chemist and a few failed attempts this is the result one thing we couldn't decide on is what to call it whether they call it bio boom mini Ultra Plus which is very mouthful or by a warm ultimate and because I don't think you can get a better filter media we went with ultimate it really is the ultimate medium and here I'll demonstrate just how far as this one is and this will be an interesting test I haven't done a capillary test like this on this new media I'm expecting it to be as good as the bio home mini ultra but with the other trace elements I'm not sure it will be so anything near that and it'll be a good result again just dip in the tip of it in oh yes I would say that's pretty porous that's porous at a massive surface area and it's got the Trias elements it's just unbelievable absolutely unbelievable and that's suck the hell of a lot into there that's hellish Timmy isn't and now I'm gonna have to wash me hands on the bench now we'll compare it to probably the main competitor which is CEM matrix right here we've got some seachem matrix straight out the top I'm only going to dip the very tip of the media in there and see how quickly it sucks it up it's my dear of how porous it is in there now come on I just don't get in see if that makes a difference yeah I think it is it's going off but not very quickly it's almost repelling the bloomin died er bear in mind that as far as and all after the biome rage has no other media's that come with added trace elements and those trace elements have been carefully picked because they are essential for bacterial colonization yes you do get them eventually in your filter but if you've already got them added in your media it cuts the already quick set-up time with the valuable media's down to just a matter of two or three weeks which is absolutely phenomenal it's I'm just so happy to have this media it's just it's excellent really excellent I've just started selling this on eBay the links below if you're watching this on YouTube and also I've got on our website as well so it's more porous than the next-best media but the other trace elements it's got a convenient size in the surface area of this media is so phenomenally big because it's made of a very very fine sound some people watching this will probably thinking this guy's just talking a load of balls and on the subject of Paul's this media in fact all of the bio media is made up of tiny balls tiny balls of silica sand that sound is mixed with a binding agent and in the case of this stuff trace elements pushed through an extruder it's basically made into these little ships then it's heat treated in a kiln everything sticks together makes it a really hard media all these tiny little balls stuck together create a ridiculously big available surface area it's not just a rock with tunnels in various ships it is a massive surface area so if you've already got filtered media you do want to get rid of it anything from the bio warm range can be mixed in with your existing filter whether it's a ceramic or plastic actually the plastic you may notice through it weird this is next the noir surface area on plastic media instead of upgrading your filter and getting the same crappy old medium in it but create the filter media that is the best way to make the filter more efficient this is the best media and it will make your filter as efficient as it possibly can be bear in mind that when external filters come from manufacturers invariably the set of wrong you can check the link in the video description after the video of how this set up an external filter pretty simple really you need three griots boom coarse medium fine followed by your media so the water goes through coarse medium fight that strains out all of the particles in the water clean water then passes to your media if you do it that way it prevents this or any other media getting blocked off and it increases its life this will last for years if you look after it ie if he protected from sludge and mochi simply set in the forms up in your filter properly will protect it and you'll get years of use out of this we're interested in buying this click the link below a supply worldwide I think I've got it listed in 500 grams which is 1.1 pounds a kilo which is 2.2 pounds three cubes which is six point six pounds five kilos which is ten point ten pounds and 10 kilo amounts which is 22 pounds anybody who's wondering what a kilo of media looks like because I wear that we really want to use kilos in Europe and also in Australia and New Zealand that is a kilo of media and that takes up approximately 1.4 cubic liters of volume if you're in sure how much you need for your filter just send me the dimensions of the trees in your filter and I can work it out for you no problem one more thing that I really should mention and it's not specific to biome media but it is specific to bacteria is these little fellas they are gel balls and these balls contain live bacteria I'll give these away with all of the media they sell and it's pretty important because unlike liquid treatments which could be sit on the shelves for years in anaerobic environment you don't know whether the stuff dead or alive you don't end all in one go these dissolve over a period of one to three weeks in your filter or in your tank or in a moving bed filter the design to move with the moving bed media they dissolve slowly so they release a measured dose of bacteria which is alive into your filter that means that your filter gets set up very efficiently and naturally you're not just dumping a load of dead bacteria and attack from a liquid treatment these are awesome,29.97002997002997,Aquarium Filter Media Explained: BioHome Mini Ultra,"An in-depth analysis and review of the BioHome filter media range, highlighting its

Wei,119328,157,3052,21700,20200122,0,hello welcome to my new home this is the empty apartment tour I'm gonna be going through the whole apartment and going through some of the renovations that I've done starting with the entranceway we just entered through the door and this is August by the way it's the lifesaver this used to be black tiling but I changed it to Marble it used to be a little bit older and it was in poor condition so I changed it out the apartment before was about 15 years old so everything was already pretty rundown so a lot of things had to be updated I'm gonna take you to the bathroom now and I redid the entire bathroom took everything out so everything here is completely new and built in based on my own design coming to the bathroom and this is what the bathroom looks like overall so starting with the tub you can see the tiling from the ground all the way up to the bathtub the bathtub I had to change out as well because like I said it was in very old condition I built this little niche here so this little niche is actually just for all your products and stuff I had to build this because before I would always have the stick-on stuff to hold my product and they would always fall down so I finally decided to just build an in-wall one so I wouldn't have that problem anymore going to the rest of the bathroom the vanity here is from Ikea the countertop is from my kitchen guy which you'll also see later when we go to the kitchen I will leave the links below for everything that I've got in here most of this stuff is actually from wayfarer except for the lights which is from Ikea and it's actually quite cheap so I will link the lights as well the toilet is my favorite toy light it's actually from Costco and it's a lot cheaper than some of the other toilets on the market and it's just the right size it's TMI but a lot bigger you know what I mean so when you sit down you're a lot more comfortable but yes so all the hardware is also from wayfarer from a brand named Moen taking you to the other side of the apartment here is the hallway into the rest of the unit I changed all the floors to this light wooden color it used to be a very dark brown and the first stop we have the closet for you no coats shoes and stuff then we have the bedroom for the bedroom I didn't actually have to update that much except for the flooring before the flooring it wasn't even laminate or wood it was just kind of this I don't know how to describe it but it kind of looks like paper material I know it's peeling off though I had to install all the new laminates as well the other thing I installed also is a light in the ceiling there was no light in the ceiling and you had to rely on a floor lamp I really wanted to have one of those lights so I can use a light switch right now we're just waiting for the installation of the chandelier so I already have it it's right here but I'm just waiting for it to be put in so that's the only thing besides the kitchen lights that are missing oh the other thing I wanted to mention there used to be a second entrance so this wall here in the corner didn't exist before it was a second entrance and there were two more sliding doors that would open into the kitchen and the living room but I really wanted to extend the kitchen because the kitchen was quite small by building the wall I was able to do that and also that way I can just rely on this one entrance alright so going to the rest of the apartment we're walking over to a kitchen now and this whole thing was also once again everything was taken out and I had to renovate the whole thing this was probably one of the biggest renovations because there were so many things that needed to be changed to go through some of the changes with you so the first one like I said with the bedroom I had to install the wall so I could extend it the kitchen used to actually only come up to here and the kitchen used to be a lot more narrow so it used to come up to here the issue with that is when I used come in here I felt very claustrophobic and the cabinets were also all worn out so we wanted to update it because a lot of the other appliances also wasn't able to fit the appliances that came with the unit before we're all very ninny so the fridge was like this narrow the oven and the stove was also only up to here so everything was just in a very mini size even dishwasher only fit about five dishes I've know that's what it looked like so I wanted to make sure everything was in just like a regular size because I spent a lot of my time in the kitchen I cooked basically every day sometimes twice or three times a day so the kitchen is extremely important to me okay so the exciting parts about the kitchen that I renovated so the countertop the one thing I really wanted was having a waterfall countertop I thought that was really nice so I extended it all the way down the hardware is all from Wayfarer but once again I will lead the links to the hardware below I also didn't want a oven in this stove I wanted just a lot more counter space which is why I often for the cooktop and this a lot of people seem to mistake in it for a dual love in which it's not this is a microwave and this is an oven I don't bake desserts or anything so when I bake it's usually just for meals so I definitely don't need a double oven the last thing I want to talk about is this faucet so I found this faucet on Wayfarer and it is actually my favorite faucet in the entire world because it has a thing here that I can turn around you can still fill up water if you want to and you can also get the spray from this guy as well so I just thought that this was a really nice touch to the rest of the kitchen and the gold match really well with Hardware on the heaviness so this was pretty much the kitchen the last thing for the living room besides the flooring as you can see is a light up here so once again this light up here didn't exist before I had to install it because like I said I don't usually like to rely on floor lamps it might mean that airs wiring in the middle of the living room so I felt like if I had a light up here it would just brighten the place up very well and it's just in the ceiling so it's not taking up much room down below this light is also from Wayfarer this is turning out to be away for commercial by the way this is not served by wayfarer at all i purchased everything here myself from wafer i found that actually shopping on and wayfarer for all these things ended up being a lot cheaper than going to specialized stores if you guys are also doing renovations i highly recommend doing wayfarer so the other thing that i got that is in the apartment even though it's empty the only thing I have is my nd mattress so I'm very excited to open this up and sleep on it tonight I've heard so many great things about the ND mattress and if you guys don't know this is a Canadian made mattress and they have a bunch of other products so I have the duvet and also the two pillows so if you guys want to try it out they have a 100 day free trial and you can use my code down below for $50 off so yeah if you guys want to give it a try you can look at the code down below so that was pretty much my entire apartment I hope you enjoyed seeing this video in a few months I'll be able to update you guys with all my

the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals and almost the end of the season I thought of an idea where we look at all 30 teams and look at ten players that you may not have known or may have forgotten about who actually played for that certain team so obviously with the Raptors and warriors heading into game number six we're going to look at both the Raptors and the Warriors but in this video we're gonna look at the Warriors and in the next episode of this series we'll look at the Raptors but I want you guys to let me know which team you want after that and I think it's just a good way to get some NBA content when it's the offseason and there is no basketball anymore so that's the plan for this series and this series will be done when we've gone through all 30 NBA teams anyway before I get started if you like this idea let me know by hitting that like button also be sure to comment on which team you'd want me to do next so without further ado let's look at ten players who you may have forgotten about playing for the Golden State Warriors and let's see how many of these guys you get right and be honest in the comments section number 10 Ralph Sampson he's number 10 but many people don't realize that apart from being one of the top spots on the what could have been list and the Houston Rockets first overall pick in the 1983 NBA Draft it was also a part of the Golden State Warriors from 1987 to 1989 Samson's incredible size and unnatural agility for a man that was seven foot four is just insane he was able to burst on the NBA scene as a rookie averaging 21 points 11 rebounds two assists two and a half blocks per game in his first season he was also named an all-star and won the NBA Rookie of the Year award but he was injured halfway into the 1987-88 season which unfortunately was not uncommon for Sampson evident through his name being one that people just remember for what could have been with Hakeem Olajuwon after making the finals in 1986 the twin towers were meant to do big things but it just wasn't meant to be Samson's knee and back troubles worsened and he never played a full season in the remaining years of his career he was only able to average six point four points and rebounds with the Golden State Warriors in 1988-89 number nine Muggsy Bogues everyone loves Mugsy I mean how can you not love Mugsy Bogues people remember him for his time in Charlotte with Larry Johnson and Alonzo Mourning after all Boggs settled in Charlotte he established himself in Charlotte as an exceptional passer a great Steeler one of the fastest players on the court and a fan favorite Bowie spent ten years in Charlotte as a Hornet led by mourning and Johnson and they became one of the most popular teams in the NBA but Mugsy Bogues also played for the Golden State Warriors averaging 5.5 points and five assists as a warrior and then signed later as a free agent with the Raptors as we all know number eight Terry Cummings if you don't know who Terry Cummings is you should because in my opinion he's one of the most underrated players that I know of he's a top 50 scorer of all time he was a rookie of the year who averaged 23 points ten point four rebounds which is insane he was averaging 16.6 points and seven rebounds threes 17-year NBA career until he joined the Warriors in which he averaged nine points and five rebounds a game for his first season and then eight points and five rebounds in his last season before retiring he's obviously best known on his time with the box where he made the all-star team twice and obviously had a great career with the Spurs as well but many people forget or don't even know about him playing for the Golden State Warriors number seven Richard Jefferson this is one of those guys where we just think of him and remember his time in Cleveland because he won a championship beating the Warriors and it always seems a little bit weird seeing him in a Warriors jersey considering the cows warriors rivalry in the last few years was insane it's one that is just easy to forget he even played for them as the average less than five points in his time in Golden State in the end he was an integral part of the Cavaliers though who actually beat the Warriors despite being down three games to one the first team in NBA history to come back being down three games to one and Richard Jefferson even over 35 years old was a huge part in that team and a great player coming off the bench and his dunk on klay Thompson still insane number six Robert Parish obviously he was best known for his time at the Celtics he spent four seasons there and one for NBA championship with thanks to Larry Bird Kevin McHale and the rest of the team but it was also a part of the Warriors in fact they're the team that drafted him parish was drafted in the first round of the 1976 NBA Draft by the Golden State Warriors but at that time he had also been drafted by the Utah Stars in the 1973 ABA specialty and he was also drafted by the Spurs in the 1975 ABA draft as well don't ask me how that works just go with it Parrish signed with the Warriors in the end and the Warriors were NBA champions in 1975 two years prior to parish's rookie season campaign however when Parrish drawn the Warriors their decline began immediately they missed the entire players completely from 1978 to 1980 and then he became a member of the Boston Celtics number five John Starks okay so did you know that stars played for the Warriors if you did did you know he played for them twice in two different occasions although he was passed over in the 1988 NBA Draft Stark's signed with the Golden State Warriors in September of 1988 as a free agent this was his rookie year the thing is if you know the Golden State Warriors you know that the 1988 draft was a special one because they drafted shooting guard Mitch Richmond as well with the fifth overall pick which meant that Stark's played limited minutes in only 36 games while Richmond won Rookie of the Year but in the second cent with the Warriors in 1999 he averaged about 14 points and five assists and was actually pretty solid before he left number four Jamal Crawford because Jamal Crawford hasn't aged a day since joining the NBA in the year 2000 apart from a few more tattoos this image of him in a Warriors jersey almost looks photoshopped but it's not and to be honest there are actually attained that should be targeting him again next season Crawford only played in 54 games for the Warriors but he did start in all of them averaging nearly 20 points a game with 4.4 assists and 1.5 rebounds but because the Warriors did not qualify for the playoffs in the 2008 onine season they traded Crawford to the Atlanta Hawks the Warriors did go on to draft curry that year so I guess it turned out all right number three can I just mention one guy's name who I think is one of the most underrated of our era but nobody ever talks about anymore is Mark Price he was so good remember how I did the check on a pick a roll he created Mark Price has been known as one of the most underrated point guards of all time he's a four-time all-star he's a two-time NBA 3-point contest winner he's part of the 50-40-90 Club he's got his jersey retired by the Cleveland Cavaliers he was a really really good player he was obviously best known as a Cleveland Cavalier with four of his also appearances being with the Cavaliers and Mark Price actually revolutionized the way that people attack on the screen and roll he was the first guy who really split the screen role and everybody knew that if they were up against mark price it was gonna be a tough night because he was seriously good anyway he actually ended up on the Golden State Warriors in the 1996 1997 NBA season when he averaged 11 points and 5 assists with a steal per game he shot 90 percent from the free-throw line almost 40% from three and about 45 percent from the field so he was extremely efficient just as he was his entire career but I reckon a lot of people who never knew that price actually was a warrior at one point number two Nick Van Exel most will probably remember Nick Van Exel from his Laker days I mean this guy crossed up players had a smooth left hand jump shot but Van Exel also spent some time in Golden State as well in fact he spent 39 games there Van Exel was traded in August of 2003 to the Golden State Warriors during the Oh 304 season he played in a career low 39 games averaging 12 points 6 points and 5.3 assists but x'l was a veteran by the time he got to the Warriors having spent most of the late 90s with the Lakers and the early 2000 with the Nuggets and the Dallas Mavericks even before then obviously it was a big demotion for Van Exel as he went from a playoff contender with the Dallas Mavericks to a team that had the longest playoff drought in the NBA at the time which obviously that made Van axle kind of not wanna play for the Warriors considering he was almost about to win an NBA championship at least try to number one Chris Webber Chris Webber now you probably know about Chris Webber playing for the Warriors I mean he got drafted there he had a crazy move on Charles Barkley behind-the-back yamdoot in his face I mean we all know that the Orlando Magic passed up on Chris Webber and they chose Penny Hardaway instead pairing Shaq and Penny instead of Shaq and Webber but this isn't this time this isn't the 1993 rookie Chris Webber playing for the gone State Warriors this is the Golden State Warriors Chris Webber of the year 2008 15 years after he got drafted their Warriors fans are probably still upset over the fact that Webber did not play his prime using Dom state because he immediately after his rookie season left the team because he didn't like the coach anyway he finished where he started as he got drafted to go on state and retarding Golden State you only played nine games for the Warriors averaging three point nine points 3.6 rebounds in 40 minutes per game and that's it that's ten plays you may have forgotten about playing for the going to say warriors and with that said if you guys enjoyed this video please be sure to

Quake-caused subsidence spreads

The Environment Ministry says nearly 6,000 square kilometers of land across Japan have subsided by more than 2 centimeters in the last fiscal year.

The figure is about 1,000 times greater than in the previous fiscal year that ended March last year, and the largest-ever since records began in 1978.

Municipal organizations that extract underground water assess land subsidence on a regular basis.

About half the 30 tested areas in 20 prefectures were recorded as sinking more than 2 centimeters. This level is judged to have a potential impact on buildings' stability.

The ministry says Kesennuma in Miyagi Prefecture sank deepest by 73.8 centimeters, followed by Ichikawa in Chiba by 30.9 centimeters. Tsukuba in Ibaraki sank by 15.2 centimeters.

Seven areas subsided by more than 10 centimeters. These lie in Tohoku, and in the Kanto region that includes Tokyo.

The ministry officials say the subsidence is attributable to last year's March 11th earthquake. They have expressed concerns over the spread of subsidence and further damage to buildings.

TJ Cox,31,0,0,32,20200309,0,"Thank you so much for being here Mrs. Combs. As my colleague Congressman Costa is saying, it's very dry out in California right now and those conditions pinpoint the need to have more storage to take advantage of wet years like last year. And I know that many of us are eagerly awaiting to see list of projects for Win Act Funding. Do you have a timeline when the Department plans to sending that list up to Congress? I think we're gonna make the deadline I think it's supposed to be made maybe next month. So we'll get back, I'll talk to reclamation, we will of course get you the list. When can we expect to Interior to start soliciting projects for actually for next year or is this just something that we do? Let me say that I will talk to Commissioner Berman and I know it's an important issue for you we will get back to you but I will talk to Commissioner Berman. Thanks so much and certainly in my district we have three major conveyance facilities. We have the Frank Kern Canal, the Delta Mendota Canal, and the California Aqueduct and these have all lost water carrying capacity because of subsidence. We're glad to see the department's made some this a priority to addressing these issues but can you talk more about the resources interest making their provision to make available for conveyance and the fixing of these facilities. With respect to the subsidence issue and the conveyance of water I know that there's a couple of options being looked at again that would defer to Commissioner Berman the question is you do you use the same path or not, I don't have the data on that but I understand it's critically important we will get that information to you. We're trying to work hand-in-hand with the Department you may know that I've introduced H.R.5316 - Move Water Now Act which is specifically which is targeted towards these conveyance facilities particularly the Frank Kern Canal. Carson, Costa, and I have another bill to address the Delta Mendota Canal and California Aqueduct very very important to what we need to be able to get water to where it's needed. Well obviously the movement of water is critical and the conveyance structures and infrastructures are critical and when you have a subsidence issue which of course you aware of the Friant Kern, we're trying to help with the state try to figure out a way to make it work, get it back operating. Thanks very much for that and we'll follow up on that. You know on another subject and I think my colleague Mr. Hughes from Colorado, made the point is that there seems to be a bit of a discrepancy or dichotomy with regard to the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Is this something that is supported by the agency? Yes in fact in my opening comments we stated that we did support it. I beg your pardon I was in an Ag committee meeting, but it seems and certainly the President the other day you know tweeted out the any comments of work of a couple senators protecting the the Conservation Fund for years to come but in his budget he's basically proposing to more or less eliminate it. Well, we support the administration's policy and we were given new direction yesterday. Well the policies is reflected in the hard numbers which is basically zero all right it's not zero but it's it's a fraction of what has been funded in the past. Well the president made clear his new direction yesterday and we are supporting that direction. Let's hope it doesn't change again. On an entirely different subject, it's very concerning that Interior removed the terms gender and sexual orientation from its 2017 ethics guide in preventing workplace discrimination against employees and replace them which is the single term sex. Since the Department of Interior was under no legal obligation to make this change, why did the Department remove sexual orientation and gender from its list of protected statuses? Well I don't have the information about that. I will tell you that Secretary Bernhardt has made it unequivocally clear that he is very supportive of diversity of all types in the Department which is why he authorized me to set up the workplace cultural diversity and counsel, and we worked very very hard on that and we'll be having a online training in about June by a vendor for all 65,000 employees on all of the issues you've raised whether it is gender, race, whatever it is going to be covered in every person in the Department will be required to take the training. We are very supportive of the appropriate, positive, inclusive culture at the Department.

640x360,453,News & Politics,Celebrity Interviews,Celebrity DR*G Addict CONVERTS To ISLAM (Islam Is Taking Over The MAIN STREAM!),"#Islam #christianity #quran 

British chef, restaurateur and television personality Marco Pierre White’s son has converted to Islam to stay off heroin, the Daily Mail reported.

28-year-old Marco Pierre White Junior, in August 2022, pleaded guilty to 14 offences of shoplifting, knife possession, heroin possession, and racially aggravated public order offences.

He was sentenced to eleven months in prison, with a 32-week suspended jail sentence previously to be run consecutively.
But now the former reality star— Big Brother, has been released from prison and claims he has sworn never to touch drugs again.

Marco Jr struggled with drug addiction since he was just 13, and has been in and out of rehab a total of 17 times.

White Jr’s conversion to Islam has reportedly been supported by his father.

“More than $1 million has been wasted because of my addictions. But Islam has helped me get through everything,” he said in an interview with MailOnline. “I have been in rehab 17 times and being in prison has made me realize that enough is enough,” he added.

[Music] [Applause] all right guys welcome back to the channel if you're new my name is Bobby guys the Avalanche of reversions to Islam continues today we're gonna check out another celebrity that reverted to Islam it is Chef Marco Pierre White's son who got jailed for multiple thefts and possession of drugs who finally reverted to e slam to stay off heroin so this headline is a mouthful of course but nothing shocks me anymore we just saw two prominent former Orthodox priests convert to Islam prominent figures like Andrew Tate converting to Islam the rise of Islam is absolutely Unstoppable it's a shame that Islam is not on the stock market man it would bypass gold silver the dollar and Bitcoin as well it's absolutely mind-blowing what has been happening over the past few months guys with no further Ado let's have a look so we are on the mirror page here the headline reads Marco Pierre White's troubled son converts to Islam to stay off heroin after prison release former reality star Marco Pierre White Jr 28 was released from hmp Bristol last week and he's claimed to have vowed to never touch drugs again after his famous chef dad reportedly spent more than a million pounds on his Rehabilitation Marco Pierre White's troubled son says he has converted to Islam to stay off heroin the Celebrity Big Brother star who has been struggling with Heroin addiction since he was 18 turned to Allah in jail according to the reports last year Marco Pierre White Jr 28 pledged guilty to 14 offenses of shoplifting possessing a knife possessing heroin and a racially aggravated public order or fence he was sentenced to 11 months with 32 weeks of a previously suspended jail term to run consecutively but now the former reality star has been released from hmp Bristol he's claimed to have vowed to never touch drugs again the celebrity Chef's son has told how he plans to follow in his Father's Footsteps and become a chef as he focuses on reform Marco Jr told the mail online how he is determined to turn his lift around and kick his addictions to the curb the tattooed ex-con told the publication more than one million pounds has wasted because of my addictions but Islam has helped me get through everything I have been in rehab 17 times and being in prison has made me realize that enough is enough Marco Jr who is Father to a three-year-old daughter revealed he was stabbed in the neck and lost six teeth while doing time due to fighting and told how he'd never been in so many fights in his life as he had been in the last 11 months he spent his sentence in hmb Bristol and channing's wood in oakwell he told how he lost three teeth in one brawl and was beaten up by a group of inmates who found out he was in for a race-hate crime before being moved to a single cell for his safety despite the difficulties faced while serving his time as the son of famous chef Marco Jr said his prison sentence is the only thing that skewed him of his addiction having spent time in rehabs all over the world he claimed being banked up in a Cell for 23 hours a day has healed him I've realized how lucky I am and have been I have seen all walks of life in prison and some people don't have a chance in life I have had every opportunity and I have thrown them all away he said I could have done anything I wanted to but instead I did heroin and ended up in prison I have been an idiot the publication reports that the recovering edit was sipping a beer forbidden in Islam during his interview but told how he now prays to Allah five times a day may God guide him he explained he was intrigued by other inmates going to pray and talking about the Islamic community and the Quran he told the publication he had a flick through the Quran and his interests grew he prayed and asked Allah to forgive his sins make him strong and protect him he also prayed for the safety of his family all of which he says has come true this is crazy how everything works out for me I do believe it has a lot to do with my prayers and my religion he explained despite the hardships of jail the Dead Set missing a year of his daughter's arabella's life has made him determined to never use drugs again he explained how he spoke to the toddler every day on the phone and told her he was at work when she begged him to come home Marco Jr said he didn't let her visit him in prison as he didn't want her to see her dad in there all right guys this is it for today's video today's news report if you will it's not surprising to me that he found Islam within prison plenty of people I talked to found Islam within the prison system there in isolation they stumble across the Quran and this truly reminds them of the blessings that they have this reminds me of Surah al-rahman where we are asked which of your Lord's favors will you then deny and this is what Marco Pierre realized of course he's been an idiot he had all the favors of his lot as we all do however he has been blessed even with more riches and what not but those riches became a curse even though he had all the money in the world this guy went out to steal it's absolutely unbelievable to see nevertheless through the hardship of the prison cell being stabbed being beaten up being in isolation he finally realized how dumb he was how misled he was how he straight away from the righteous path it's absolutely amazing to see how this man found faith I truly hope that this article is partially fake and that he wasn't sipping a beer hopefully if he did however then let's pray for him that he ditches that addiction as well alright guys but this is it for this video if you liked it leave the thumbs up if you haven't subscribed already guys please do so and if you want to support this Channel all the links are in the
